URLs cannot have spaces. Instead, all spaces in a string are replaced with %20. Write an algorithm that replaces all spaces in a string with %20.

You may not use the replace() method or regular expressions to solve this problem. Solve the problem with and without recursion.

Example
Input: "Jasmine Ann Jones"
Output: "Jasmine%20Ann%20Jones"


let createAUrl = (s, n = s.length) => {
	let out = " ";
	let characters = 0;

	for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
	let c = s[i];
	if (c !==' '){
		characters++;
	}
}

let spaces = n - characters;

for ( let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
	let c = s[i];
	if (c ===' ' && spaces > 0) {
	out += '%20';
	} else if (c !==' ') {
	out += c;
	}

	return out;
	}
}
}
